## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- Monitor ridership in real-time.
- Track the locations of public transportation vehicles.
- Predict arrival times for improved passenger experience.
- Provide a user-friendly public platform for accessing real-time transit information.

## Components
The project consists of the following components:
1. **IoT Sensor System**: Hardware and software for data collection within transportation vehicles.
2. **Real-Time Transit Information Platform**: A web or mobile application for public access to transit data.
3. **Data Processing Backend**: Backend logic for data processing, analysis, and prediction, developed using Python.
4. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation for setup and usage.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the IoT sensor hardware and software in public transportation vehicles.
3. Deploy the Real-Time Transit Information Platform to a web server.
4. Configure the data processing backend.
5. Run tests and monitor the system's performance.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [documentation](/docs).

## Usage
Provide instructions on how to use the platform and access real-time transit information. Include examples of API endpoints, user guides, and any necessary setup.
